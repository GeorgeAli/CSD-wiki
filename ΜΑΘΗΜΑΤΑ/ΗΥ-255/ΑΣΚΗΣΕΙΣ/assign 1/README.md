------------------

	- The translate program uses a struct table containing a three char
	  table for storing the mappings in an initialize function like that:
		cmap[iso8859-7_number].rep[0-2]
	- The state functions return an enum state.
	- There's a warning in some gcc versions:
		"comparison between pointer and integer"
	  such a comparison is done (with the NULL pointer) to check if some of
	  the .rep[] cells are uninitialized to stop printing of the respective
	  characters.
	- The help from others focuses on searching on programming forums about
	  one or two interesting points (basically on tables containing
	  functions). Of course some abstract conversation took place with some
	  of my collegues.
	- Most of the overall time was spent on the initialization mappings
	  rather than the designing process.
