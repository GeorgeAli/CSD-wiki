* Ποιες διαφορες μεταξύ **Processes vs Threads**;
Processes | Threads
--- | ---
Processes are heavyweight operations |	Threads are lighter weight operations
Each process has its own memory space	 | Threads use the memory of the process they belong to
Inter-process communication is slow as processes have different memory addresses | Inter-thread communication can be faster than inter-process communication because threads of the same process share memory with the process they belong to
Context switching between processes is more expensive	| Context switching between threads of the same process is less expensive
Processes don’t share memory with other processes	| Threads share memory with other threads of the same process
