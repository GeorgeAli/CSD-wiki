## Ποιες διαφορες μεταξύ **Processes vs Threads**;

Processes | Threads
--- | ---
Processes are heavyweight operations |	Threads are lighter weight operations
Each process has its own memory space	 | Threads use the memory of the process they belong to
Inter-process communication is slow as processes have different memory addresses | Inter-thread communication can be faster than inter-process communication because threads of the same process share memory with the process they belong to
Context switching between processes is more expensive	| Context switching between threads of the same process is less expensive
Processes don’t share memory with other processes	| Threads share memory with other threads of the same process
 
## Τι είναι Map Reduce;
MapReduce is a processing technique and a program model for distributed computing based on java. The MapReduce algorithm contains two important tasks, namely Map and Reduce. Map takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value pairs).

## Τι είναι Mutexes;
**Mutual exclusion** object (*mutex*) is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously

## Τι είναι Reader-Writer Locks;
**Readers–writer** (RW) or shared-exclusive lock is a synchronization primitive that solves one of the readers–writers problems*. An RW lock allows concurrent access for read-only operations, while write operations require exclusive access. This means that multiple threads can read the data in parallel but an exclusive lock is needed for writing or modifying data. When a writer is writing the data, all other writers or readers will be blocked until the writer is finished writing. A common use might be to control access to a data structure in memory that cannot be updated atomically and is invalid (and should not be read by another thread) until the update is complete.

## Ποιες και τι είναι Scheduling policies;
* Scheduling policies
> Scheduling is the method by which work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work. The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows, which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors, network links or expansion cards.

* Scheduling disciplines
> Scheduling disciplines are algorithms used for distributing resources among parties which simultaneously and asynchronously request them.

## Τι είναι Consistancy;

## Τι είναι Contention;

## Τι είναι Load Balancing;

## Τι είναι Scheduler Sefication;

## Τι είναι Lock Avoidance όταν χρησιμοποιούμε shared data;
